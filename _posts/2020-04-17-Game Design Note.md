# Principles Game Design 


## Level Design

1. balance between exploration & action (state flow) 
2. e.g. like Inside, once puzzle is solved 它应该是容易复现的,而不是要很多操作的

3. tips of level design: 
-   Begin with conceptual work (why the level exists, how it fits into the whole game; develop a focus for your level; provide variety; grid paper 
-   landmarks (like the carsel in the Disney land)
- Architecture of level (design for purposes = meaningful play, 
- progress report)
- 成长曲线, 先易后难,适时给一些小高潮
- Flow Control: how to prevent him from returning 
- Show the player they are doing right.
- Treat them differently, satisfy different kind of people
- Other tips:
	- Use AI effectively
	- Asset sequencing (don't want them getting stuff too early)
	- Avoid player getting suck
	- Progressively reveal eye candy. (tell them this is now and rewards to them)

## Balance

imbalance 简称 imba - 阴霸 我现在才知道这个词是这么来的

首先, balance 固然是重要的,但是 imbalance 也不全是坏事, 有时候这是玩家很大的乐趣。


Player don't know statistic. Sometimes, we need to sacrifices the perfect equation or the realism.
